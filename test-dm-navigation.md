# DM Navigation Fix Test

## Changes Made

1. **DMList Component (DMList.tsx)**:
   - Added optional `onSwitchToDMs` prop
   - Modified `handleConversationSelect` to call `onSwitchToDMs()` when clicking a conversation from the sidebar
   - Added logging to track when view switching occurs

2. **App Component (App.tsx)**:
   - Updated DMs view layout to show both DMList sidebar and DMChat side by side
   - Added proper styling with nexus-glass and border classes
   - Passed `handleShowDMs` callback to DMList when rendered in Friends sidebar
   - No callback passed when DMList is in main DMs view (since no view switch needed)

## Expected Behavior

### From Friends Menu:
1. User is in Friends view (`currentView === 'friends'`)
2. DMList is rendered in the sidebar with `onSwitchToDMs={handleShowDMs}`
3. When user clicks a DM conversation:
   - `handleConversationSelect` is called
   - `setActiveConversation(conversation)` sets the active conversation
   - `onSwitchToDMs()` is called, which triggers `handleShowDMs()`
   - `handleShowDMs()` calls `onViewChange('dms')` to switch to DMs view
   - View changes to DMs, showing the DMList sidebar + DMChat layout
   - The clicked conversation should be active and displayed

### From DMs Menu:
1. User is in DMs view (`currentView === 'dms'`)
2. DMList is rendered in the sidebar WITHOUT `onSwitchToDMs` callback
3. When user clicks a DM conversation:
   - `handleConversationSelect` is called
   - `setActiveConversation(conversation)` sets the active conversation
   - No view switching occurs (since `onSwitchToDMs` is undefined)
   - The conversation content updates in DMChat

## Test Steps

1. **Start the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Login** with a test account
3. **Go to Friends view** (click Friends in sidebar)
4. **Verify DM conversations** are visible in the sidebar under "Direct Messages"
5. **Click on a DM conversation** from the Friends sidebar
6. **Verify view switches** to DMs view automatically
7. **Verify the conversation opens** in the main chat area
8. **Test clicking other conversations** in the DM sidebar to ensure they switch properly

## Technical Details

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- DMList works both as a sidebar component (with view switching) and main component (without)
- Proper TypeScript typing with optional props
- Console logging added for debugging
- Layout uses proper Discord-like structure with sidebar + main chat area
