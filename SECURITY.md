## Security Features

Nexus implements multiple layers of security:

### End-to-End Encryption
- AES-256-CBC encryption for all messages
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Zero-knowledge architecture - server cannot read messages
- Channel-specific encryption keys

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens with refresh rotation
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds)
- HTTP-only cookies for token storage
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS/WSS for all communications
- CORS protection configured
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical Security Issues
For critical security vulnerabilities, please **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue.

**Contact us directly:**
- **Email**: security@nexus.example.com
- **Response Time**: Within 24 hours for critical issues
- **Encryption**: You may encrypt sensitive reports using our PGP key (available upon request)

2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** assessment
4. **Affected versions** if known
5. **Proof of concept** (if applicable)
6. **Suggested mitigation** (if any)

### Process Timeline

| Stage | Timeline | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Acknowledgment** | 24 hours | We confirm receipt of your report |
| **Initial Assessment** | 72 hours | We evaluate severity and impact |
| **Investigation** | 1-2 weeks | We investigate and develop fixes |

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep Nexus secure:

- **Hall of Fame**: Public recognition in our security page
- **CVE Credit**: Proper attribution in CVE databases
- **Direct Communication**: Priority channel for future reports

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- **Strong Passwords**: Use unique, complex passwords
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable when available (future feature)
- **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version of Nexus
- **Secure Environment**: Keep your browser and OS updated

### For Developers
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates for dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions

### For Administrators
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Database Security**: Use strong credentials and network isolation
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
- **Regular Backups**: Encrypted backups with tested recovery procedures

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Scope
This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- Nexus application code
- Infrastructure configuration
- Third-party dependencies
- Deployment configurations

### Authorized Testing
You may test for vulnerabilities if you:
- Use your own test accounts
- Don't access other users' data
- Don't perform DoS attacks
- Don't exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes
- Report findings responsibly

### Prohibited Activities
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks on infrastructure
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Accessing other users' private data
- Destructive testing

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Password Recovery**: Lost passwords cannot recover encrypted messages (by design)
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Encryption keys are device-specific
- **Message Integrity**: HMAC verification not yet implemented
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Key rotation not yet implemented

### Planned Improvements
- Message integrity verification (HMAC)
- Perfect Forward Secrecy with key rotation
- Cross-device key synchronization
- Hardware security key support
- Advanced threat detection

## Security Audits

### External Audits
- **Status**: Planned for Q2 2025
- **Scope**: Full application security review
- **Focus**: Cryptographic implementation and key management

### Internal Reviews
- **Frequency**: Quarterly security reviews
- **Automated**: Daily dependency vulnerability scans
- **Static Analysis**: Every commit analyzed with CodeQL

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment
- **OWASP Top 10**: All risks addressed
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Controls implemented
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management aligned

### Privacy
- **GDPR Compliant**: User data rights respected
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data collected
- **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive data encrypted

## Contact Information

### Security Team
- **Email**: security@nexus.example.com
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request
- **Response SLA**: 24 hours for critical issues

### General Support
- **GitHub Issues**: For non-security bugs
- **Discussions**: For questions and feature requests
- **Documentation**: Check our comprehensive docs first
