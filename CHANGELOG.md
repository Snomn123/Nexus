## Migration Guides

### From 0.9.x to 1.0.0
1. **Database Migration**: Run `npm run migrate` to add encryption fields
2. **Environment Variables**: Update `.env` files with new security settings
3. **Client Update**: Users will need to log in again to initialize encryption
4. **Breaking Changes**: None - fully backward compatible

### Security Notice
Starting with v1.0.0, all new messages are encrypted by default. Existing messages remain unencrypted but are clearly marked in the UI. For maximum security, consider asking users to start fresh conversations after the update.
